# Create a Drawing Program with Shapes!

## Repl.it Setup

We're going to use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) to create the project. It is an online IDE!

Create a new repl and use Python as the language.

### Let's Begin Creating the Program


## Importing Libraries
Let's begin by importing the turtle and math libraries.

```js
import turtle
import math
```

- We will be drawing to the screen using the turtle library!
- The math library will be used later!

## Creating Variables
Now lets create some variables.
```js
import turtle
import math

squareWidth = 20
circleRadius = 10
triangleLength = 20

itemNum = 0
maxItem = 3

colorNum = 0 
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "grey", "black"]
```

- We are creating variables for the width of the square, radius of the circle, and length of the triangle.
- We are setting the max amount of shapes we will draw under "maxItem" and "itemNum" is our index to start at.
- "colorNum" is the index we are starting at with the array of "colors"

## Initializing Turtle
Let's initialize the turtle.
```js
#Code we already wrote

turtle.hideturtle()
turtle.speed(0)
turtle.up()
```
- We are hiding the turtle cursor.
- We are setting the speed to 0 so it will draw instantly.
- We are making the turtle go up.
